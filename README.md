# Mini-Project

Implementing an UI that displays results in computer science.

# PROPERTIES

There will be Users, papers and Subject in the system. These entities will have the following properties: 

  • **User**: Name and surname. They are not necessarily unique independently but you can assume there exists only one author with a name and surname couple. 
  • **Paper**: Author, title, abstract, topic and result. Each paper may have multiple authors, yet it has only one result. Moreover, titles are unique though a paper can have multiple topics. 
  • **Subject**: Name and  result. By definition, both are unique. 

##  Requirements:


**UI with following operations: **
 
  • Only admins shall be able to add/update/delete papers, authors and topics.  
  • Users shall be able to separately view all authors, papers and topics in the system.
  • Users shall be able to view all papers of an author. 
  • Users shall be able to view  result by topic and which paper this  was achieved.  
  • Users shall be able to view papers on a specific topic.
